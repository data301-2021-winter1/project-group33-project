# Group 033 - Wildfire data analysis

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_WT1/data301/project/milestone02.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic is Canadian wildfires. Canada is affected by hundreds of wildfires every year across the country and these fires have an impact on many different areas. Wildfires can impact wildlife, natural resourses, travel and air quality. Fires close to populated areas can also endanger people and their property. The is lots of research to be done in the field of wildfires to learn more about how fires start and spead, and about how best to prevent, control, and stop them. Since wildfires are geographic in nature, much of the data science work related to wildfires is done using GIS and there are many shapfile datasets available with wildfire data. Since GIS data is beyond the scope of this course, we have chosen a more conventional data set with various datapoints about Canadian wildfires.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set shows how the area burnt and number of fires (for all Canadian provinces) vary due to different factors (fire cause, fire size, month)  from 1990 to 2020 and the corresponding property damage. The data set has been provided by the National Forestry Database (NFD), and it has been provided under the mandate of NFD which is to collect and compile national forest data and forest management statistics. The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) at Natural Resources Canada developed and maintains the NFD database. The CFS collects fire related data from various federal, provincial or territorial resource management organisations and then compiles it within the NFD database.
