Stu:
I'm interested in seeing if there is any trend in the number of fires per year in a given province. I expect that the trend may show a wavy pattern between more and fewer fires. I think that it would make sense that after a year with more fires, most of the available fuel has been burned and there will be fewer fires the next year. Conversely after a year or 2 with fewer fires natural fuel will build up and provide conditions for more fires. I also still want to possibly add in some additional data. Maybe compare the number of fires per year with the rate of global warming? or checking if higher average temperature for a year correlates with more fires. I also want to look at how the cause of fire relates to area burned or property losses (do human stated fires cause more or less damage?).

Salman: For the given area burnt and number of fires, I want to analyze:
    - How does the cause-of-fire vary from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and if it is possible to determine/identify any trends e.g. I would like to know, over years, in which provinces and territories, more fires have been caused by man, as opposed to lighting etc.
    - How does the size-of-fire vary from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and identify any trends/patterns e.g. as time goes by, is there a particular fire size range (e.g. 10.1-100 ha) that us more prevalent; what is the most common fire-size seen in different provinces and territories?
    - How do the fires vary each year (over 12 months) from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and identify any trends/patterns/outliers e.g. are there particular months and years, when fires are more common/prevalent; is there a particular year when there were either far greater/lesser number-of-fires or far (area-wise) large/small fires prevalent?
    - Identify any relationship b/w area-burnt, number of fires and property damaged experienced for different provinces and territories

Andrew Kang: It is quite a common sense that any fire incidence should be treated as early as possible. However, in many cases due to varies reason a wildfire may not be discovered or treated at its earliest stage.  In my own prediction, if there are a massive number of fires happening in a relatively short period time, the fire department will be exhausted and overwhelmed, which will be unable to responds to some of the fire right away(after the fire was discovered). In the data set, this prediction should appear in the data set as when the number of fire in each month goes up, the average amount of area burned by each fire (number of fire/total area burned in the same month) would also goes up. If this prediction happen to be true, then it would means that the fire department need more crew, and the corresponding solution would be hire more crew in order to put down the fire quicker.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set shows how the area burnt and number of fires (for all Canadian provinces) vary due to different factors (fire cause, fire size, month)  from 1990 to 2020 and the corresponding property damage. The data set has been provided by the National Forestry Database (NFD), and it has been provided under the mandate of NFD which is to collect and compile national forest data and forest management statistics. The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) at Natural Resources Canada developed and maintains the NFD database. The CFS collects fire related data from various federal, provincial or territorial resource management organisations and then compiles it within the NFD database.
