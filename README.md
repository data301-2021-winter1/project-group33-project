## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/2021_WT1/data301/project/milestone02.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Salman: For the given area burnt and number of fires, I want to analyze:
    - How does the cause-of-fire vary from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and if it is possible to determine/identify any trends e.g. I would like to know, over years, in which provinces and territories, more fires have been caused by man, as opposed to lighting etc.
    - How does the size-of-fire vary from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and identify any trends/patterns e.g. as time goes by, is there a particular fire size range (e.g. 10.1-100 ha) that us more prevalent; what is the most common fire-size seen in different provinces and territories?
    - How do the fires vary each year (over 12 months) from 1990 to 2020 for different provinces and territories, and identify any trends/patterns/outliers e.g. are there particular months and years, when fires are more common/prevalent; is there a particular year when there were either far greater/lesser number-of-fires or far (area-wise) large/small fires prevalent?
    - Identify any relationship b/w area-burnt, number of fires and property damaged experienced for different provinces and territories


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set shows how the area burnt and number of fires (for all Canadian provinces) vary due to different factors (fire cause, fire size, month)  from 1990 to 2020 and the corresponding property damage. The data set has been provided by the National Forestry Database (NFD), and it has been provided under the mandate of NFD which is to collect and compile national forest data and forest management statistics. The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) at Natural Resources Canada developed and maintains the NFD database. The CFS collects fire related data from various federal, provincial or territorial resource management organisations and then compiles it within the NFD database.
